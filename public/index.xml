      <description>Wanted to work with Jekyll but Configuring Ruby on Mac Was Very Frustrating And how I nailed it Hello, It&amp;rsquo;s Tarif Haque a noob dev.
I love simplicity. Maybe you do that as well.
Whatever! The idea of modern static websites always intrigued me. But I never had the opportunity to dig deeper.
Suddenly, I came across GitHub pages. Simply put, it&amp;rsquo;s a free hosting service for static pages by GitHub.</description>

      <title>Coding for Non Engineers in 2022</title>

      <description>Let&amp;rsquo;s face it. We, the non-engineering background people, usually see the world of codes with fearful reverence.
Nonetheless, we want to learn it with all our hearts (at least a few of us genuinely do).
And we believe in some myths like, &amp;ldquo;You need to be super-good at maths to be a programmer,&amp;rdquo; etc.
Now I&amp;rsquo;m a business grad. And I have been in this phase.
But thankfully, I have been working in a software company for a few years now.</description>

      <description>Born in 1991 in Kurigram, a remote northern town in Bangladesh. It was so remote that even national newspapers used to take around 24 hours to reach. Raised with a mind full of dreams, with science fiction books and videocassette movies. I grew a knack for IT in those early days of my life. Tried to read material about the new internet things like email, search engines, viruses, or anything.</description>
