      <description>Last week I visited my hometown, Kurigram. For the first time, by a train. It is one of the most remote parts of Bangladesh. The journey was relatively smooth and took around nine hours.
I booked quad seats for my family.
Train Quad-Seats: Two seats facing each other, with a small table between The quad seats made me feel like writing something&amp;hellip; If I had no kids with me, I would have written something on the table in my writing pad or played chess, I was thinking.</description>

      <description>Wanted to work with Jekyll but
Configuring Ruby on Mac Was Very Frustrating
and how I nailed it
Hello, It&amp;rsquo;s Tarif Haque a noob dev.
I love simplicity. Maybe you do that as well.
Whatever! The idea of modern static websites always intrigued me. But I never had the opportunity to dig deeper.
Suddenly, I came across GitHub pages. Simply put, it&amp;rsquo;s a free hosting service for static pages by GitHub.</description>

      <title>Coding for Non Engineers in 2022</title>

      <description>Let&amp;rsquo;s face it. We, the non-engineering background people, usually see the world of codes with fearful reverence.
Nonetheless, we want to learn it with all our hearts (at least a few of us genuinely do).
And we believe in some myths like, &amp;ldquo;You need to be super-good at maths to be a programmer,&amp;rdquo; etc.
Now I&amp;rsquo;m a business grad. And I have been in this phase.
But thankfully, I have been working in a software company for a few years now.</description>
