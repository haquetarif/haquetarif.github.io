  "articleBody": " “For routine jobs, you need clerks; for battles, soldiers; and for wars, generals. But for a Revolution, my friend, you need common men and women, millions of them, with a common dream.”\n— Tarif Haque\nMore than Hundred Killed \u0026 Thousands Injured, Curfew Declared Right now, my country, Bangladesh, is undergoing a long awaited revolution. It started as a very simple demonestration by some students for fair and logical reform of the quota system for government jobs. For the first few days it was mostly peaceful and government also didn’t show it’s iron fist.\nThings started to trun grim after the Prime Minister, Sheikh Hasina, made a deragatory comment towards the protesting students calling them progenies of “Razakars” (collaborators of Pakistani Military during the Independence War of Bangladesh who have commited one of the deadliest war crimes in human history). It was the point of no return for the movement and a pivotal moment for the history of Bangladesh, I would say.\nThe following day, students got outraged but they remain non-violent. But the member of the “student” wing of the Party of Hasina, Bangladesh Student League (BSL) with the aid of police, and university “administration” cracked down on the unarmed general students. The made examples of unprecendented atrocities. Especially, their brutal attack on women was so terrible that literally shook the whole nation. Six students were killed and thousand injured. And this was the beginning of the end.\nThe next day, the country erupted like a volcano. Rage of all spheres of outbrust. But the government and the political party in power was yet to show it’s final round. Crack down on protesters went on all across the country. In three days more than one hundred people were killed and thousands injured. Now the movement started to turn violent. People react by attacing police vehicles, government infrastructure and clashing with the ruling political party.\nThe situation went out of control of the ruling junta (you may know thre is no fair election in the country for around one and a half decades). Now they declared a curfew all across the country from 12:00 AM of 20th July. All kinds of internet is blocked. PM Hasina cancells her pre-planned tour to Spain. On the other hand the protesting students sought a nine-point demand before they can sit for a negotiation.\nUp until this part of the write-up was written on 20th July 2024.\nFor days, we lived in a digital blackout, cut off from the world. The government had silenced the internet, hoping to suppress our voices, but our resolve only grew stronger. Now, as my beloved country stands victorious, having claimed its long-cherished freedom, it feels like a dream realized. Today, I want to reflect on the chain of events that brought us to this historic moment—a journey from despair to triumph, forged by the courage of ordinary people.\nEarly Phase: How It All Started 5 June\nThe situation ignited on June 5 when the High Court reinstated a job quota that reserves 30% of civil service positions for the children and grandchildren of “freedom fighters” from the Bangladesh Liberation War. This ruling sparked immediate reactions across various sectors of society. It has to be mentioned that the list of “freedom fighters” of the 1971 independence war of Bangladesh is highly controversial. Almost all of the ruling governments have increased the number of enlisted people. Several national media reported forgery and corruption in the freedomfighter enlisting process.\n6 June\nIn response to the quota ruling, students from six universities organized peaceful protests to express their dissent. These demonstrations highlighted widespread concerns regarding fairness and equal opportunity in civil service recruitment. While the protests temporarily subsided due to the Eid ul Adha celebrations, tensions remained high, and the movement quickly reignited following the festivities.\nVigorous Movement After Eid 7 July\nStudents staged a blockade, demanding the rescission of the controversial job quota system.\nBangla Blockade and Chhatra League Attacks\n10 July\nAt approximately 11:00 AM, a protest march at the University of Dhaka began in front of the library, passing the Raju Memorial Sculpture, and culminating in a blockade at Shahbagh intersection. Law enforcement set up barricades to obstruct the students. In the afternoon, the High Court announced a four-week hold on its ruling regarding the quota system, urging the students to disperse. The blockade disrupted Dhaka’s transport system, halting long-distance buses and trains. Police also clashed with protesting students at Comilla University.\n11 July\nThe Shahbagh blockade began at 04:30 PM after rain delayed the initial start time. Dhaka College students retreated, while those from Dhaka University joined with students from Jagannath University. By 09:00 PM, the students ended their agitation, planning a protest march on 12 July to denounce police violence.\n12 July\nAt 05:00 PM, students gathered at Shahbagh for another blockade. During protests at Comilla Victoria College, Chhatra League members attacked protesters, beating a student who was recording the incident.\n13 July\nStudents in Rajshahi blocked railway tracks, and DU students held a press conference in Dhaka, claiming attempts were being made to stifle their movement through legal actions.\n14 July\nStudents marched in Dhaka, conducting sit-ins and submitting a memorandum to President Mohammed Sahabuddin. Following the Prime Minister’s controversial remarks referring to protesting students as the “children of Razakars,” a midnight demonstration occurred at Dhaka University, with female students breaking locks on their dorm. The government ordered a 4G network shutdown in the area, and Chhatra League members attacked protesters at the University of Chittagong.\n15 July\nThe attacks escalated after the ruling Awami League’s general secretary claimed the Chhatra League would retaliate against protesters. In Jessore, a Chhatra League member assaulted a demonstrator. In Dhaka, Chhatra League members attacked students in Bijoy Ekattor Hall, injuring two journalists during the assault. Later, they attempted to storm the emergency department of Dhaka Medical College Hospital, targeting injured students and vandalizing ambulances. The Chhatra League also attacked Rajshahi University students, injuring six.\nProtesters called for nationwide demonstrations in all educational institutions at 03:00 PM on the following day 16 July.\nThe Legend of Abu Sayed: Valor in a Month of Blood and Tears 16 July\nAround 12:15 AM, members of the Chhatra League attacked students from Jahangirnagar University with firearms. The students sought refuge at the vice-chancellor’s residence after breaking its lock. Approximately 300 Chhatra League members, armed with pipes and sticks, attacked the students with bricks and glass bottles. Shots were fired, injuring two journalists and over 50 student protesters. Police arrived but placed blame on the students for the chaos.\nA violent incident occurred at Begum Rokeya University in Rangpur between 2:30 PM and 3:00 PM, where police used batons and fired shots. A student named Abu Sayed died from gunshot wounds after being taken to the hospital. His unprecedented heroism and sacrifice spread like wildfire across the country.\nAt around 3:30 PM, Chhatra League members attacked protesters in the Farmgate area. When protesters took shelter in the Farmgate metro station, the attackers followed and assaulted them. Police were allegedly called to control the situation, but the station authorities denied claims of any damage.\nAs public university students were forced to vacate, students from various schools, colleges, and private universities joined protests against the Chhatra League’s violence. Protests spread to multiple institutions, causing significant traffic disruptions.\nStudents blocked railway lines in Chattogram and Mohakhali, and highways connecting Dhaka to other regions were obstructed.\nIn the evening, the Ministry of Education announced the indefinite closure of schools and colleges, and the UGC declared all public and private universities would remain closed until further notice.\nA symbolic funeral prayer for the deceased was scheduled for July 17.\n17 July\nClashes erupted with police following the funeral prayer program organized by student protesters, the BNP, and other parties to honor those killed on July 16.\nThe government ordered all students to vacate residential halls. Students rejected this order, leading to further confrontations with police.\nStudents blocking the Dhaka-Barisal highway announced a total shutdown for July 18, demanding justice and a terror-free campus.\nPM Sheikh Hasina addressed the nation, announcing a judicial inquiry into the deaths during the protests and emphasizing the need for patience.\nStudents erected the Shaheed Smriti Stambha, a memorial pillar, to honor the deceased.\n18 July\nPolice clashed with BRAC University students in Badda, using batons and tear gas. Dhaka Metro Mirpur-10 station was closed due to arson.\nReports indicated that approximately 30 students were killed by police during the unrest.\nMinister of Law Anisul Haque urged students to end their movement.\nA pro-protester group hacked the official websites of several government entities in response to the violence.\nThe government shut down internet access nationwide, and a second-year student drowned while fleeing police during clashes.\n19 July\nThe Dhaka Metropolitan Police announced a ban on public gatherings to hinder protests. Train services were shut down to prevent protesters from mobilizing.\nCalls for protests continued nationwide, with teachers at Rajshahi University wearing black face coverings in solidarity.\nPolice fired on a crowd in Bhairab Thana, injuring over a hundred students. Clashes occurred in multiple areas of Dhaka.\nProtests escalated, leading to a curfew being imposed and troops being deployed nationwide.\n20 July\nNegotiations began between the Anti-discrimination Students’ Movement and the government.\nDuring these discussions, Nahid Islam, a quota reform movement coordinator, was allegedly abducted but later released, claiming to have been tortured.\nThe Supreme Court reduced the percentage of quotas from 56% to 7%.\n22 July\nFollowing the Supreme Court verdict, the Anti-discrimination Students’ Movement announced a two-day suspension of protests but continued to demand the lifting of curfews and restoration of internet access.\nMass detentions of student leaders persisted despite the suspension of protests.\nThe government gradually relaxed curfew restrictions, allowing businesses to reopen.\n23 July\nThe ICT Minister announced partial restoration of broadband internet service to certain sectors after a five-day disruption.\n24-28 July\nBroadband internet services were fully restored, while mobile internet remained limited, with some social media platforms still blocked.\nCoordinators of the Anti-discrimination Students’ Movement released a statement withdrawing from protests, but claims emerged that they were coerced into doing so.\n29 July\nLarge-scale demonstrations resumed across the country after the government ignored demands to release detained leaders.\nPolice arrested over 2,800 students in Dhaka.\nUniversity professors organized rallies demanding an end to student harassment and solidarity with the protests.\n30 July\nA cabinet meeting declared July 30 as a day of national mourning for those killed during the protests.\nPublic sentiment remained divided, with many rejecting official mourning and insisting justice be served for the deceased.\n31 July\nProtests continued, and discussions around the demands of the Anti-discrimination Students’ Movement persisted, as students remained active in calling for justice and systemic change.\nThe Second Freedom 1 August\nIn memory of those killed, injured, and tortured by police during the 2024 quota reform movement, the Anti-Discrimination Student Movement announced a nationwide program titled “Remembering the Heroes” on 1 August. This announcement was made in a press release signed by Rifat Rashid, one of the co-coordinators of the movement, on 31 July. He also called for online and offline campaigns in support of the movement and in memory of the martyrs, using the hashtags #JulyMassacre and #RememberingOurHeroes on social media platforms.\nAt 12:30 PM, teachers and students of Jahangirnagar University held a protest song rally and cultural gathering to protest the attacks on Dhaka University teachers, the mass arrests of protesting students and citizens, and the harassment through false cases. In solidarity with the movement, twelve teachers from Daffodil International University participated in the JU event.\nAfter the 24-hour ultimatum for the unconditional release of the six coordinators of the quota reform movement expired, several prominent citizens, including Iftekharuzzaman, Syeda Rizwana Hasan, and Asif Nazrul, announced plans to visit the DB office on the afternoon of 1 August.\nThe government banned the Bangladesh Jamaat-e-Islami, its student wing Bangladesh Islami Chhatra Shibir, and associated bodies, citing anti-terrorism laws following their involvement in the protests. As of the morning of 1 August, 274 cases had been filed against students in various police stations in Dhaka Metropolitan, resulting in the arrest of 3,011 students by the Dhaka Metropolitan Police.\nThe police released six student leaders in an effort to calm tensions and forestall further demonstrations. Upon their release from the DB office, several coordinators announced their intention to continue the movement and shared statements on social media.\nIn Narayanganj, a Candlelight Vigil program organized in support of “Remembering the Heroes” was disrupted by police intervention, resulting in injuries to at least ten students due to police baton charges.\n2 August\nProtesters in Rangpur chanted Shame shame Hasina, we can’t live out of shame\", seeking justice for victims affected by the unrest and police crackdown following the release of student leaders. This release did not alleviate public anger, leading to renewed protests. Demonstrators demanded the reopening of schools and universities across the country and called for Sheikh Hasina’s resignation. Clashes erupted as police fired rubber bullets, tear gas shells, and sound grenades in several locations, including Uttara, Khulna, Sylhet, and Habiganj. Tragically, one police officer was beaten to death by protesters in Khulna, while one civilian lost their life in Habiganj.\nDue to the unrest, internet service providers restricted access to Facebook, WhatsApp, and Telegram. After five hours, access to Facebook and Messenger was restored, but Telegram remained restricted.\nOn the same day, the six coordinators previously detained by the Detective Branch claimed they had been coerced into retracting their support for the movement, alleging that the statement was obtained under duress for national broadcast. Amid ongoing violence and sabotage incidents related to the quota reform movement, 78 HSC candidates arrested in related cases were granted bail from various courts across the country.\nThe United Nations agency for children and culture, UNICEF, expressed concern over the deaths of at least 32 children during the protest crackdown surrounding the 2024 Quota Reform Movement in Bangladesh in July. Sanjay Wijesekera, UNICEF Regional Director for South Asia, urged swift measures to ensure that children could return to school.\n3 August\nIn the early hours of the day, another injured person succumbed to their injuries while receiving treatment.\nPrime Minister Sheikh Hasina proposed peaceful talks with the protesters, stating, “The doors of Ganabhaban are open. I want to sit with the quota protesters and listen to them. I do not want conflict.”\nHowever, in the afternoon, central coordinator Nahid Islam announced that the movement had no plans to negotiate with the government. He stated, “When we were in DB custody, we were offered to sit in talks with the Prime Minister. But we protested against this proposal by going on a hunger strike in DB custody.” Asif Mahmud, another coordinator of the Anti-Discrimination Student Movement, asserted, “We have no plans to negotiate with them. Our demands are very clear. If they have any statements, they can present them to the nation through the media. The decision of the protesting students and people is our decision. There is no dialogue with bullets and terrorism.”\nAt the program, freedom fighter Md. Sharif Hossain expressed his support for the students, urging all freedom fighters to join the movement. Around 10:30 AM, students from various educational institutions in Rajshahi marched and gathered in front of the Rajshahi University of Engineering and Technology (RUET), chanting slogans. Students and ordinary citizens gathered at the Central Shaheed Minar area, where Nahid Islam addressed the assembled crowd. The Anti-Discrimination Student Movement announced a single demand for the resignation of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina and her cabinet, calling for a comprehensive non-cooperation movement starting 4 August, marking the end of the quota protests.\nThe court granted bail to Arif Sohel, a coordinator of the Anti-Discrimination Student Movement, although he had not yet been released.\nIn Chittagong, there was an attack on the residence of Education Minister Mohibul Hasan Chowdhury, during which two cars parked in front of the house were vandalized, and one was set on fire. Earlier, around 5:30 PM, there was also an attack on the office of Md Mohiuddin Bacchu, the Member of Parliament for Chittagong-10, located in Lalkhan Bazar, where the office was set on fire.\nIn Sreepur, Gazipur, one person was killed during clashes between police and protesting students. In Rangpur, two police officers were temporarily suspended in connection with the death of Abu Sayed, a student at Begum Rokeya University and a key coordinator of the quota reform movement.\nDuring an anti-discrimination student movement in Sylhet, clashes occurred between the police and students, resulting in over a hundred injuries.\nAt around 1:30 PM in Race Course, Comilla, leaders and activists of the Chhatra League, Jubo League, and Swechchhasebak League attacked a mass rally of anti-discrimination student movement protesters. During this attack, they opened fire on the students, resulting in 10 students being shot and a total of 30 people being injured.\nIn Bogra, repeated clashes occurred between protesting students and the police. From 4 PM to around 6 PM, these confrontations lasted nearly two hours, during which the police fired tear gas shells, sound grenades, rubber bullets, and shotgun rounds. Several areas of the city, including Satmatha, Circuit House Mor, Romena Afaz Road, Kalibari Mor, Bir Muktijoddha Rezaul Baki Road, and Jailkhana Mor, turned into battlegrounds. At least six students were shot, and an additional fifty students were injured.\nNon-cooperation Movement 4 August\nThe day became the deadliest of the protests, with around 91 people killed, including 14 police officers. Clashes erupted between protesters and police while protesters blocked major highways. Police stations and Awami League offices were targeted by rioters. The police used tear gas and claimed to have fired rubber bullets, although some people were injured and killed by actual bullets. The renewed demonstrations led the government to shut down the internet and declare an indefinite nationwide curfew starting from 6 PM.\nSheikh Hasina criticized the protesting students, stating that those who engage in “sabotage” and destruction were no longer students but “terrorists,” while the protesters continued to call for her resignation.\nFall of a Tyrant and Rise of a Nation 5 August\nPrime Minister Sheikh Hasina resigned and fled the country to India, “for her own safety,” according to her son, Sajeeb Wazed.\nDuring a televised address to the nation, Chief of the Army Staff General Waker-uz-Zaman announced the resignation and stated that an interim government would be formed following talks with major political parties, excluding the Awami League, the former prime minister’s party.\n",

<p>Right now, my country, Bangladesh, is undergoing a long awaited revolution. It started as a very simple demonestration by some students for fair and logical reform of the quota system for government jobs. For the first few days it was mostly peaceful and government also didn&rsquo;t show it&rsquo;s iron fist.</p>
<p>Things started to trun grim after the Prime Minister, Sheikh Hasina, made a deragatory comment towards the protesting students calling them <strong>progenies of &ldquo;Razakars&rdquo;</strong> (collaborators of Pakistani Military during the Independence War of Bangladesh who have commited one of the deadliest war crimes in human history). It was the point of no return for the movement and a pivotal moment for the history of Bangladesh, I would say.</p>
<p>The following day, students got outraged but they remain non-violent. But the member of the &ldquo;student&rdquo; wing of the Party of Hasina, Bangladesh Student League (BSL) with the aid of police, and university &ldquo;administration&rdquo; cracked down on the unarmed general students. The made examples of unprecendented atrocities. Especially, their brutal attack on women was so terrible that literally shook the whole nation. Six students were killed and thousand injured. And this was the <strong>beginning of the end.</strong></p>
<p>The next day, the country erupted like a volcano. Rage of all spheres of outbrust. But the government and the political party in power was yet to show it&rsquo;s final round. Crack down on protesters went on all across the country. In three days more than one hundred people were killed and thousands injured. Now the movement started to turn violent. People react by attacing police vehicles, government infrastructure and clashing with the ruling political party.</p>
<p>The situation went out of control of the ruling junta (you may know thre is no fair election in the country for around one and a half decades). Now they declared a curfew all across the country from 12:00 AM of 20th July. All kinds of internet is blocked. PM Hasina cancells her pre-planned tour to Spain. On the other hand the protesting students sought a nine-point demand before they can sit for a negotiation.</p>
<p><strong>Up until this part of the write-up was written on 20th July 2024.</strong></p>
<p>For days, we lived in a digital blackout, cut off from the world. The government had silenced the internet, hoping to suppress our voices, but our resolve only grew stronger. Now, as my beloved country stands victorious, having claimed its long-cherished freedom, it feels like a dream realized. Today, I want to reflect on the chain of events that brought us to this historic moment—a journey from despair to triumph, forged by the courage of ordinary people.</p>

<p><strong>5 June</strong><br>
The situation ignited on June 5 when the High Court reinstated a job quota that reserves 30% of civil service positions for the children and grandchildren of &ldquo;freedom fighters&rdquo; from the Bangladesh Liberation War. This ruling sparked immediate reactions across various sectors of society. It has to be mentioned that the list of &ldquo;freedom fighters&rdquo; of the 1971 independence war of Bangladesh is highly controversial. Almost all of the ruling governments have increased the number of enlisted people. Several national media reported forgery and corruption in the freedomfighter enlisting process.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>6 June</strong><br>
In response to the quota ruling, students from six universities organized peaceful protests to express their dissent. These demonstrations highlighted widespread concerns regarding fairness and equal opportunity in civil service recruitment. While the protests temporarily subsided due to the Eid ul Adha celebrations, tensions remained high, and the movement quickly reignited following the festivities.</p>

Police were allegedly called to control the situation, but the station authorities denied claims of any damage.</p>
<p>As public university students were forced to vacate, students from various schools, colleges, and private universities joined protests against the Chhatra League&rsquo;s violence. Protests spread to multiple institutions, causing significant traffic disruptions.</p>

<h3 id="the-second-freedom">The Second Freedom<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#the-second-freedom">#</a></h3>
<p><strong>1 August</strong></p>
<p>In memory of those killed, injured, and tortured by police during the 2024 quota reform movement, the Anti-Discrimination Student Movement announced a nationwide program titled <strong>&ldquo;Remembering the Heroes&rdquo;</strong> on 1 August. This announcement was made in a press release signed by Rifat Rashid, one of the co-coordinators of the movement, on 31 July. He also called for online and offline campaigns in support of the movement and in memory of the martyrs, using the hashtags <strong>#JulyMassacre</strong> and <strong>#RememberingOurHeroes</strong> on social media platforms.</p>
<p>At 12:30 PM, teachers and students of Jahangirnagar University held a protest song rally and cultural gathering to protest the attacks on Dhaka University teachers, the mass arrests of protesting students and citizens, and the harassment through false cases. In solidarity with the movement, twelve teachers from Daffodil International University participated in the JU event.</p>
<p>After the 24-hour ultimatum for the unconditional release of the six coordinators of the quota reform movement expired, several prominent citizens, including Iftekharuzzaman, Syeda Rizwana Hasan, and Asif Nazrul, announced plans to visit the DB office on the afternoon of 1 August.</p>
<p>The government banned the Bangladesh Jamaat-e-Islami, its student wing Bangladesh Islami Chhatra Shibir, and associated bodies, citing anti-terrorism laws following their involvement in the protests. As of the morning of 1 August, 274 cases had been filed against students in various police stations in Dhaka Metropolitan, resulting in the arrest of 3,011 students by the Dhaka Metropolitan Police.</p>
<p>The police released six student leaders in an effort to calm tensions and forestall further demonstrations. Upon their release from the DB office, several coordinators announced their intention to continue the movement and shared statements on social media.</p>
<p>In Narayanganj, a Candlelight Vigil program organized in support of &ldquo;Remembering the Heroes&rdquo; was disrupted by police intervention, resulting in injuries to at least ten students due to police baton charges.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>2 August</strong></p>
<p>Protesters in Rangpur chanted Shame shame Hasina, we can&rsquo;t live out of shame&quot;, seeking justice for victims affected by the unrest and police crackdown following the release of student leaders. This release did not alleviate public anger, leading to renewed protests. Demonstrators demanded the reopening of schools and universities across the country and called for Sheikh Hasina’s resignation. Clashes erupted as police fired rubber bullets, tear gas shells, and sound grenades in several locations, including Uttara, Khulna, Sylhet, and Habiganj. Tragically, one police officer was beaten to death by protesters in Khulna, while one civilian lost their life in Habiganj.</p>
<p>Due to the unrest, internet service providers restricted access to Facebook, WhatsApp, and Telegram. After five hours, access to Facebook and Messenger was restored, but Telegram remained restricted.</p>
<p>On the same day, the six coordinators previously detained by the Detective Branch claimed they had been coerced into retracting their support for the movement, alleging that the statement was obtained under duress for national broadcast. Amid ongoing violence and sabotage incidents related to the quota reform movement, 78 HSC candidates arrested in related cases were granted bail from various courts across the country.</p>
<p>The United Nations agency for children and culture, UNICEF, expressed concern over the deaths of at least 32 children during the protest crackdown surrounding the 2024 Quota Reform Movement in Bangladesh in July. Sanjay Wijesekera, UNICEF Regional Director for South Asia, urged swift measures to ensure that children could return to school.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>3 August</strong></p>
<p>In the early hours of the day, another injured person succumbed to their injuries while receiving treatment.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina proposed peaceful talks with the protesters, stating, <strong>&ldquo;The doors of Ganabhaban are open. I want to sit with the quota protesters and listen to them. I do not want conflict.&rdquo;</strong></p>
<p>However, in the afternoon, central coordinator Nahid Islam announced that the movement had no plans to negotiate with the government. He stated, <strong>&ldquo;When we were in DB custody, we were offered to sit in talks with the Prime Minister. But we protested against this proposal by going on a hunger strike in DB custody.&rdquo;</strong> Asif Mahmud, another coordinator of the Anti-Discrimination Student Movement, asserted, <strong>&ldquo;We have no plans to negotiate with them. Our demands are very clear. If they have any statements, they can present them to the nation through the media. The decision of the protesting students and people is our decision. There is no dialogue with bullets and terrorism.&rdquo;</strong></p>
<p>At the program, freedom fighter Md. Sharif Hossain expressed his support for the students, urging all freedom fighters to join the movement. Around 10:30 AM, students from various educational institutions in Rajshahi marched and gathered in front of the Rajshahi University of Engineering and Technology (RUET), chanting slogans. Students and ordinary citizens gathered at the Central Shaheed Minar area, where Nahid Islam addressed the assembled crowd. The Anti-Discrimination Student Movement announced a single demand for the resignation of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina and her cabinet, calling for a comprehensive non-cooperation movement starting 4 August, marking the end of the quota protests.</p>
<p>The court granted bail to Arif Sohel, a coordinator of the Anti-Discrimination Student Movement, although he had not yet been released.</p>
<p>In Chittagong, there was an attack on the residence of Education Minister Mohibul Hasan Chowdhury, during which two cars parked in front of the house were vandalized, and one was set on fire. Earlier, around 5:30 PM, there was also an attack on the office of Md Mohiuddin Bacchu, the Member of Parliament for Chittagong-10, located in Lalkhan Bazar, where the office was set on fire.</p>
<p>In Sreepur, Gazipur, one person was killed during clashes between police and protesting students. In Rangpur, two police officers were temporarily suspended in connection with the death of Abu Sayed, a student at Begum Rokeya University and a key coordinator of the quota reform movement.</p>
<p>During an anti-discrimination student movement in Sylhet, clashes occurred between the police and students, resulting in over a hundred injuries.</p>
<p>At around 1:30 PM in Race Course, Comilla, leaders and activists of the Chhatra League, Jubo League, and Swechchhasebak League attacked a mass rally of anti-discrimination student movement protesters. During this attack, they opened fire on the students, resulting in 10 students being shot and a total of 30 people being injured.</p>
<p>In Bogra, repeated clashes occurred between protesting students and the police. From 4 PM to around 6 PM, these confrontations lasted nearly two hours, during which the police fired tear gas shells, sound grenades, rubber bullets, and shotgun rounds. Several areas of the city, including Satmatha, Circuit House Mor, Romena Afaz Road, Kalibari Mor, Bir Muktijoddha Rezaul Baki Road, and Jailkhana Mor, turned into battlegrounds. At least six students were shot, and an additional fifty students were injured.</p>

<p><strong>4 August</strong></p>
<p>The day became the deadliest of the protests, with around 91 people killed, including 14 police officers. Clashes erupted between protesters and police while protesters blocked major highways. Police stations and Awami League offices were targeted by rioters. The police used tear gas and claimed to have fired rubber bullets, although some people were injured and killed by actual bullets. The renewed demonstrations led the government to shut down the internet and declare an indefinite nationwide curfew starting from 6 PM.</p>
<p>Sheikh Hasina criticized the protesting students, stating that those who engage in <strong>&ldquo;sabotage&rdquo;</strong> and destruction were no longer students but <strong>&ldquo;terrorists,&rdquo;</strong> while the protesters continued to call for her resignation.</p>

<p><strong>5 August</strong></p>
<p>Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina resigned and fled the country to India, &ldquo;for her own safety,&rdquo; according to her son, Sajeeb Wazed.</p>
<p>During a televised address to the nation, Chief of the Army Staff General Waker-uz-Zaman announced the resignation and stated that an interim government would be formed following talks with major political parties, excluding the Awami League, the former prime minister&rsquo;s party.</p>
