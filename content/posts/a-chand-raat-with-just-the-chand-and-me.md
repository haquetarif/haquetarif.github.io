Eid Mubarak...

Last night was feeling very low. Got my bike and went out. Didn't expect to find this much peace and serenity all around. Couldn't capture even a tiny fraction of the therapeutic solitude. The rhythms of lights and shadows. The whisper of the bugs. Smell of the soil just after rain.

Soon realized, I was not alone. The moon followed me like a good old friend and I felt like no one and nothing else mattered anymore... After some time I started listening to music...

> Hey, Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me I'm not sleepy and there is no place I'm going to

Felt like this moon has come to me as my Tambourine Man or Woman tonight...

How has your chand raat been?
