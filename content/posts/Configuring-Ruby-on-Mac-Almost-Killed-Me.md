Hello, It's Tarif Haque a noob dev. 

I love simplicity. Maybe you do that as well. 

Whatever! The idea of modern static websites always
intrigued me. But I never had the opportunity to dig
deeper.

Suddenly, I came across GitHub pages. Simply put,
it's a free hosting service for static pages by GitHub.
Again, you can get an awesome <username>.github.io
Subdomain for free.

Such a project seems to be too interesting to forgo.

Again, in the docs, I found out it allows some ruby-based thing called Jekyll to make awesome static sites.

So I started to install Jekyll on my mac.

But to do so you need Ruby and Gem etc. up to date. 

I tried my best... like to the point of going crazy over
a few days.

But it was almost impossible to work with the system ruby 
in the BigSur version of Mac.

I searched almost everything and finally got a clue that
updating Mac to the latest Monterey can solve this.

The update was more than 12 GB for me. It took a lot of time.

But finally, it worked. And I've written this blog in .MD 
(markdown file).

And you are seeing this via Jekyll (now in Hugo, that's another story for some other day). 

The lesson of the day is 

**"Being adamant is the key to becoming a Dev. Never give up!"**
