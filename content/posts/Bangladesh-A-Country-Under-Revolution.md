| <b>More than Hundred Killed & Thousands Injured, Curfew Declared</b>                                     |

Right now, my country, Bangladesh, is undergoing a long awaited revolution. It started as a very simple demonestration by some students for fair and logical reform of the quota system for government jobs. For the first few days it was mostly peaceful and government also didn't show it's iron fist.

Things started to trun grim after the Prime Minister, Sheikh Hasina, made a deragatory comment towards the protesting students calling them **progenies of "Razakars"** (collaborators of Pakistani Military during the Independence War of Bangladesh who have commited one of the deadliest war crimes in human history). It was the point of no return for the movement and a pivotal moment for the history of Bangladesh, I would say.

The following day, students got outraged but they remain non-violent. But the member of the "student" wing of the Party of Hasina, Bangladesh Student League (BSL) with the aid of police, and university "administration" cracked down on the unarmed general students. The made examples of unprecendented atrocities. Especially, their brutal attack on women was so terrible that literally shook the whole nation. Six students were killed and thousand injured. And this was the **beginning of the end.**

The next day, the country erupted like a volcano. Rage of all spheres of outbrust. But the government and the political party in power was yet to show it's final round. Crack down on protesters went on all across the country. In three days more than one hundred people were killed and thousands injured. Now the movement started to turn violent. People react by attacing police vehicles, government infrastructure and clashing with the ruling political party. 

The situation went out of control of the ruling junta (you may know thre is no fair election in the country for around one and a half decades). Now they declared a curfew all across the country from 12:00 AM of 20th July. All kinds of internet is blocked. PM Hasina cancells her pre-planned tour to Spain. On the other hand the protesting students sought a nine-point demand before they can sit for a negotiation.

**Up until this part of the write-up was written on 20th July 2024.**

For days, we lived in a digital blackout, cut off from the world. The government had silenced the internet, hoping to suppress our voices, but our resolve only grew stronger. Now, as my beloved country stands victorious, having claimed its long-cherished freedom, it feels like a dream realized. Today, I want to reflect on the chain of events that brought us to this historic moment—a journey from despair to triumph, forged by the courage of ordinary people.

### Early Phase: How It All Started

**5 June**  
The situation ignited on June 5 when the High Court reinstated a job quota that reserves 30% of civil service positions for the children and grandchildren of "freedom fighters" from the Bangladesh Liberation War. This ruling sparked immediate reactions across various sectors of society. It has to be mentioned that the list of "freedom fighters" of the 1971 independence war of Bangladesh is highly controversial. Almost all of the ruling governments have increased the number of enlisted people. Several national media reported forgery and corruption in the freedomfighter enlisting process.

* * *

**6 June**  
In response to the quota ruling, students from six universities organized peaceful protests to express their dissent. These demonstrations highlighted widespread concerns regarding fairness and equal opportunity in civil service recruitment. While the protests temporarily subsided due to the Eid ul Adha celebrations, tensions remained high, and the movement quickly reignited following the festivities.

### Vigorous Movement After Eid

**7 July**  
Students staged a blockade, demanding the rescission of the controversial job quota system.

**Bangla Blockade and Chhatra League Attacks**  
**10 July**  
At approximately 11:00 AM, a protest march at the University of Dhaka began in front of the library, passing the Raju Memorial Sculpture, and culminating in a blockade at Shahbagh intersection. Law enforcement set up barricades to obstruct the students. In the afternoon, the High Court announced a four-week hold on its ruling regarding the quota system, urging the students to disperse. The blockade disrupted Dhaka's transport system, halting long-distance buses and trains. Police also clashed with protesting students at Comilla University.

The Shahbagh blockade began at 04:30 PM after rain delayed the initial start time. Dhaka College students retreated, while those from Dhaka University joined with students from Jagannath University.

The government ordered a 4G network shutdown in the area, and Chhatra League members attacked protesters at the University of Chittagong.

**15 July**  
The attacks escalated after the ruling Awami League's general secretary claimed the Chhatra League would retaliate against protesters. In Jessore, a Chhatra League member assaulted a demonstrator. In Dhaka, Chhatra League members attacked students in Bijoy Ekattor Hall, injuring two journalists during the assault. Later, they attempted to storm the emergency department of Dhaka Medical College Hospital, targeting injured students and vandalizing ambulances.

Protesters called for nationwide demonstrations in all educational institutions at 03:00 PM on the following day 16 July.

### The Legend of Abu Sayed: Valor in a Month of Blood and Tears

**16 July**

Around 12:15 AM, members of the Chhatra League attacked students from Jahangirnagar University with firearms. The students sought refuge at the vice-chancellor's residence after breaking its lock. Approximately 300 Chhatra League members, armed with pipes and sticks, attacked the students with bricks and glass bottles. Shots were fired, injuring two journalists and over 50 student protesters. Police arrived but placed blame on the students for the chaos.

A violent incident occurred at Begum Rokeya University in Rangpur between 2:30 PM and 3:00 PM, where police used batons and fired shots. A student named **Abu Sayed** died from gunshot wounds after being taken to the hospital. His unprecedented heroism and sacrifice spread like wildfire across the country.

At around 3:30 PM, Chhatra League members attacked protesters in the Farmgate area. When protesters took shelter in the Farmgate metro station, the attackers followed and assaulted them. Police were allegedly called to control the situation, but the station authorities denied claims of any damage.

As public university students were forced to vacate, students from various schools, colleges, and private universities joined protests against the Chhatra League's violence. Protests spread to multiple institutions, causing significant traffic disruptions.

Students blocked railway lines in Chattogram and Mohakhali, and highways connecting Dhaka to other regions were obstructed.

### The Second Freedom

**1 August**

In memory of those killed, injured, and tortured by police during the 2024 quota reform movement, the Anti-Discrimination Student Movement announced a nationwide program titled **"Remembering the Heroes"** on 1 August. This announcement was made in a press release signed by Rifat Rashid, one of the co-coordinators of the movement, on 31 July. He also called for online and offline campaigns in support of the movement and in memory of the martyrs, using the hashtags **#JulyMassacre** and **#RememberingOurHeroes** on social media platforms.

At 12:30 PM, teachers and students of Jahangirnagar University held a protest song rally and cultural gathering to protest the attacks on Dhaka University teachers, the mass arrests of protesting students and citizens, and the harassment through false cases. In solidarity with the movement, twelve teachers from Daffodil International University participated in the JU event.

After the 24-hour ultimatum for the unconditional release of the six coordinators of the quota reform movement expired, several prominent citizens, including Iftekharuzzaman, Syeda Rizwana Hasan, and Asif Nazrul, announced plans to visit the DB office on the afternoon of 1 August.

The government banned the Bangladesh Jamaat-e-Islami, its student wing Bangladesh Islami Chhatra Shibir, and associated bodies, citing anti-terrorism laws following their involvement in the protests. As of the morning of 1 August, 274 cases had been filed against students in various police stations in Dhaka Metropolitan, resulting in the arrest of 3,011 students by the Dhaka Metropolitan Police.

The police released six student leaders in an effort to calm tensions and forestall further demonstrations. Upon their release from the DB office, several coordinators announced their intention to continue the movement and shared statements on social media.

In Narayanganj, a Candlelight Vigil program organized in support of "Remembering the Heroes" was disrupted by police intervention, resulting in injuries to at least ten students due to police baton charges.

**2 August**

Protesters in Rangpur chanted Shame shame Hasina, we can't live out of shame", seeking justice for victims affected by the unrest and police crackdown following the release of student leaders. This release did not alleviate public anger, leading to renewed protests. Demonstrators demanded the reopening of schools and universities across the country and called for Sheikh Hasina’s resignation. Clashes erupted as police fired rubber bullets, tear gas shells, and sound grenades in several locations, including Uttara, Khulna, Sylhet, and Habiganj. Tragically, one police officer was beaten to death by protesters in Khulna, while one civilian lost their life in Habiganj.

Due to the unrest, internet service providers restricted access to Facebook, WhatsApp, and Telegram. After five hours, access to Facebook and Messenger was restored, but Telegram remained restricted.

On the same day, the six coordinators previously detained by the Detective Branch claimed they had been coerced into retracting their support for the movement, alleging that the statement was obtained under duress for national broadcast. Amid ongoing violence and sabotage incidents related to the quota reform movement, 78 HSC candidates arrested in related cases were granted bail from various courts across the country.

In the early hours of the day, another injured person succumbed to their injuries while receiving treatment.

Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina proposed peaceful talks with the protesters, stating, **"The doors of Ganabhaban are open. I want to sit with the quota protesters and listen to them. I do not want conflict."**

However, in the afternoon, central coordinator Nahid Islam announced that the movement had no plans to negotiate with the government. He stated, **"When we were in DB custody, we were offered to sit in talks with the Prime Minister. But we protested against this proposal by going on a hunger strike in DB custody."** Asif Mahmud, another coordinator of the Anti-Discrimination Student Movement, asserted, **"We have no plans to negotiate with them. Our demands are very clear. If they have any statements, they can present them to the nation through the media. The decision of the protesting students and people is our decision. There is no dialogue with bullets and terrorism."**

At the program, freedom fighter Md. Sharif Hossain expressed his support for the students, urging all freedom fighters to join the movement. Around 10:30 AM, students from various educational institutions in Rajshahi marched and gathered in front of the Rajshahi University of Engineering and Technology (RUET), chanting slogans. Students and ordinary citizens gathered at the Central Shaheed Minar area, where Nahid Islam addressed the assembled crowd. The Anti-Discrimination Student Movement announced a single demand for the resignation of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina and her cabinet, calling for a comprehensive non-cooperation movement starting 4 August, marking the end of the quota protests.

The court granted bail to Arif Sohel, a coordinator of the Anti-Discrimination Student Movement, although he had not yet been released.

At around 1:30 PM in Race Course, Comilla, leaders and activists of the Chhatra League, Jubo League, and Swechchhasebak League attacked a mass rally of anti-discrimination student movement protesters. During this attack, they opened fire on the students, resulting in 10 students being shot and a total of 30 people being injured.

In Bogra, repeated clashes occurred between protesting students and the police. From 4 PM to around 6 PM, these confrontations lasted nearly two hours, during which the police fired tear gas shells, sound grenades, rubber bullets, and shotgun rounds. Several areas of the city, including Satmatha, Circuit House Mor, Romena Afaz Road, Kalibari Mor, Bir Muktijoddha Rezaul Baki Road, and Jailkhana Mor, turned into battlegrounds.

### Non-cooperation Movement

**4 August**

The day became the deadliest of the protests, with around 91 people killed, including 14 police officers. Clashes erupted between protesters and police while protesters blocked major highways. Police stations and Awami League offices were targeted by rioters. The police used tear gas and claimed to have fired rubber bullets, although some people were injured and killed by actual bullets. The renewed demonstrations led the government to shut down the internet and declare an indefinite nationwide curfew starting from 6 PM.

Sheikh Hasina criticized the protesting students, stating that those who engage in **"sabotage"** and destruction were no longer students but **"terrorists,"** while the protesters continued to call for her resignation.

### Fall of a Tyrant and Rise of a Nation

**5 August**

Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina resigned and fled the country to India, "for her own safety," according to her son, Sajeeb Wazed.

During a televised address to the nation, Chief of the Army Staff General Waker-uz-Zaman announced the resignation and stated that an interim government would be formed following talks with major political parties, excluding the Awami League, the former prime minister's party.
