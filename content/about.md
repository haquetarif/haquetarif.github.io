#### Born in 1991 in Kurigram, a remote northern town in Bangladesh. It was so remote that even national newspapers used to take around 24 hours to reach.

Raised with a mind full of dreams, with science fiction books and videocassette movies. I grew a knack for IT in those early days of my life. Tried to read material about the new internet things like email, search engines, viruses, or anything. 

There was no computer in my town until the early 2000s. But I came to Dhaka, the capital city of our country when I was a teen. There I used the computer and internet for the first time. I got spellbound with the awesomeness of the technology. Especially the way it can eliminate the barrier of distance and spread information amazed me the most.


Fast forward to **2011**, I first came across WordPress as a CMS. Then, I **co-founded a website** analyzing global socio-political movements [[archived version]](https://web.archive.org/web/20110527082600/http://move4world.com/).

It was my first startup. Though it failed, I learned a lot working on this.

I've worked for different organizations mostly as Freelance Web Development Consultant.

In **2020**, I joined [weDevs](https://wedevs.com/), a leading WordPress development company. I worked there as an **Acting Product Manager**. I led the development of weMail, an email marketing SaaS solution.

In **2022**, I was hired by [CNS Ltd.](https://site.cnsbd.com/), a big IT company with around one thousand of employees as a **Business Analyst** in the Software & System department. Currenly I'm working here in a **World Bank** Funded Bangladesh Insurance Sector Development Project (BISDP). I worked on and ERP (Accounts) mainly. I also worked on orther parts like Business Intelligence and HRMS. I worked for CNS for 2 years.

This year **2024**, I have started working as a **Business Analsyst** at [Apsis Solutions](https://apsissolutions.com/). Like CNS, here I also work on ERP and HRMS products.

I love to stargaze, walk in the moonlight, and read books when I'm free.

I live in Dhaka, Bangladesh with my lovely wife and two cute mischievous kids.

I'm trying to create this personal blog using Hugo. I've hosted it on GitHub.
